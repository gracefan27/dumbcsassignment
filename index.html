    <h2> Courses </h2>
     <div class="ib i2">
    <h3> MOS 1021A/B </h3>
        <p> This course is an introduction to two topics: human resources, and consumer behaviour and marketing. It cover everything from the basics of recruiting to market research to branding principles. You receive an excellent preview of these core business concepts for further studies in business.</p>
        <p> This course gave a very good overview of crucial topics in business. The professor was also very helpful and always connected course concepts to real-life examples, making everything more applicable and easier to study for me. I have learned a lot about how companies recruit and manage people and how brands establish and market themselves.</p>
    <h3> MOS 1023A/B </h3>
        <p> This course is an introduction to accounting and finance, going through everything from financial statements to auditing to core financial topics. You receive the essential foundation needed to move on in business or pursue accounting and finance at a more advanced level. </p>
        <p> Accounting and finance are not my favourite topics, so for me the course has been a bit tedious at times, but my professor tries to make it exciting and has shared lots of stories from his days as an accountant. I know this course will give me the basic accounting and financial knowledge I need to pursue a business career. </p>
    <h3> Business 1220E </h3>
        <p> This course gives a brief overview of all the essential topics in business: finance, marketing, operations, organizational behaviour and general management. You receive an introduction to the case method and you are challenged to think critically. </p>
        <p> This has been my favourite course in first year because of the interactive nature of the course, and the small size of the class. I am able to get to know my professor and form an actual relationship. I have learned so much about business from this course, and have learned to properly analyze, form opinions and make implications. </p>
